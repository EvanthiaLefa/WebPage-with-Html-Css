        <h3>The term of herbs!</h3>
        In botany, the term herb refers to a herbaceous plant,<br> defined as a small, seed-bearing plant without a woody stem in which all aerial parts <br>
        die back to the ground at the end of each growing season.<br>
         Usually the term refers to perennials,<br>
        although herbaceous plants can also be annuals <br>
        or biennials. This term is in contrast to shrubs and trees which possess a woody stem.<br>
         Shrubs and trees are also defined in terms of size, <br>
        where shrubs are less than ten meters tall, and trees may grow over ten meters.<br>
        The word herbaceous is derived from Latin herbāceus meaning "grassy".

        <h3>MORE INFO!</h3>
        Herbal tea is not technically a true tea, <br>
        as it does not derive from the Camellia sinensis plant. <br>
        Instead, herbal tea is an infusion or blend of various leaves, <br>
        fruits, bark, roots, or flowers belonging to almost any edible, non-tea plant.<br>
        Most of these brews don’t have caffeine. You can <br>
        start with premade bags or loose material you steep <br>
        and then strain out. Herbal teas are also called “tisanes.”</div>
